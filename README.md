<h1>Sass Style Sheets</h1>
<br />

<p>
 Sass (which stands for 'Syntactically awesome style sheets) is an extension of CSS that enables designer to use things like variables, nested rules, inline imports and more. It also helps to keep things organised and allows designer to create style sheets faster. Sass is compatible with all versions of CSS.
